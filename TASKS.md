# Build Tasks — WES Work Planning & Release

Build the full bounded context described in CLAUDE.md. Work in this order; keep
`go build ./...` and `go test ./...` green as you go. Read
/Users/claudioed/docs/amazon-fulfillment-ddd.md for the domain model before coding.

## Task 0 — Project skeleton
- `go mod init github.com/claudioed/wes-work-planning`
- Create the directory layout from CLAUDE.md. Add .gitignore (bin/, .env).
- Add deps: chi/v5, pgx/v5, golang-migrate (CLI usage only in README).

## Task 1 — Domain layer (pure Go, no imports outside stdlib)
- shared: value objects CPT (time-based, ordering), Rate (units/hour), PathId,
  Quantity, StationCount; a DomainEvent type + concrete events (see CLAUDE.md).
- charge: ChargeForecast aggregate (CPT buckets → quantities).
- plan: PathPlan + ShiftPlan aggregates. Enforce plannedHeads ≤ installedStations.
- workunit: WorkUnit aggregate — states (Pending→Released→Completed), carries CPT,
  at-most-once assignment, no double-complete.
- release: WorkPool aggregate (priority by CPT, at-most-once handout, WIP limit
  invariant on release-fed pools) + a ReleasePolicy domain service.
- Unit tests for EVERY invariant, including the failing paths.

## Task 2 — Application layer
- ports: define OUT interfaces — ChargeRepo, PlanRepo, WorkPoolRepo,
  WorkUnitRepo, EventPublisher, Clock.
- usecases: one struct per use case in CLAUDE.md (ReceiveChargeForecast,
  CommitShiftPlan, EnqueueWorkUnit, ReleaseNextWork, RecordCompletion,
  SampleBacklog, RebalanceDecision). Depend only on domain + ports.
- Unit-test use cases against the in-memory adapter.

## Task 3 — Outbound adapters
- memory: in-memory implementations of every port (thread-safe).
- postgres: pgxpool-backed repos + migrations (charge, plan, work_pool,
  work_unit, events tables). Build-tag integration tests (skip w/o DATABASE_URL).
- events: an EventPublisher that logs + buffers; leave a kafka-ready interface.

## Task 4 — Inbound HTTP adapter
- chi router, handlers for every endpoint in CLAUDE.md, request/response DTOs,
  domain-error → HTTP status mapping, /healthz.
- httptest integration tests per endpoint wired to in-memory repos.

## Task 5 — Composition root & ops
- cmd/wes/main.go wires config (env) → adapters → use cases → router.
- docker-compose.yml (Postgres 16). README.md with run steps + curl examples.

## Task 6 — Verify
- `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...` all green. Fix until they are.
- Confirm the three invariants each have a red-path test.

## Task 7 — Cross-service integration (additive, see CLAUDE.md's new section)
- Add `github.com/segmentio/kafka-go` dependency.
- New Kafka outbound publisher adapter (publishes WorkReleased) selected via
  EVENT_PUBLISHER env, default stays "log" so nothing existing breaks.
- New Kafka inbound consumer for ShiftPlanCommitted (from workforce) and
  StockReserved/ReservationRevoked (from inventory).
- New read-model packages: internal/domain/laborview (by path_id),
  internal/domain/inventoryview (by sku). New repos/ports/adapters (memory +
  postgres) for each, new migration for processed_events + the two view tables.
- New GET endpoints: /paths/{pathId}/labor-plan-view, /inventory-view/{sku}.
- Idempotency via processed_events table (Postgres) / map (memory); unit test
  double-delivery has no double effect.
- Build-tagged (`integration`) test against the shared broker at localhost:9092
  (docker-compose.kafka.yml in ~/warehouse-systems), skipped w/o KAFKA_BROKERS.
- README gains an Integration section. Do a REAL smoke test against the running
  shared broker before declaring done (publish a message, curl the view endpoint).
- Full existing suite (build/vet/test/-race) must still be green afterward.

## Task 8 — Consume TaskCompleted (additive, see CLAUDE.md's Task 8 section)
- Add a THIRD topic subscription to the existing Task 7 Kafka consumer:
  warehouse.fulfillment.events, filtering event_type "TaskCompleted".
- Map data.work_unit_id -> RecordCompletionRequest.WorkUnitId and call the
  existing RecordCompletion use case directly. Do not modify RecordCompletion.
- Reuse the existing processed_events idempotency mechanism from Task 7.
- Unit test: fake TaskCompleted envelope invokes RecordCompletion once;
  redelivery of the same event_id does not invoke it again.
- README's Integration section gains this new topic. REAL smoke test: with the
  shared broker running, publish a TaskCompleted message for a work unit
  currently in Released state and confirm it transitions to Completed.
- Full existing suite (build/vet/test/-race), including Tasks 0-7, must stay green.

## Task 10 — Quality engineering: linting, coverage, integration tests, mutation tests, CI
Full spec in QUALITY.md at the repo root. Five ordered stages, each gates the
next: (1) golangci-lint clean via the committed .golangci.yml, (2) unit test
coverage >= 90% on internal/domain/... + internal/application/... combined,
(3) real integration tests against live Postgres for every outbound Postgres
adapter, (4) gremlins mutation testing on internal/domain/... only
(exploratory, triaged not gated), (5) .github/workflows/ci.yml — lint+unit+
integration blocking on every push/PR, mutation testing on a weekly schedule/
manual dispatch only, never blocking PRs. Do not stop until every stage's
Definition of Done in QUALITY.md is met, then report the final numbers.

## Task 11 — REST API hardening + OpenAPI 3.0.3 docs + Spectral CI gate
Full spec in REST_API_TASK.md at the repo root. Four ordered stages: (1) audit
this service's HTTP adapter against REST/HTTP Level 2 maturity and fix real
violations (resource nouns, correct verbs/status codes, Location headers,
input validation), (2) migrate all error responses from the bespoke
{"error":...} shape to RFC 7807 application/problem+json, (3) write a very
detailed openapi.yaml (3.0.3) covering every route with full request/response
schemas and real domain-grounded examples, (4) add a new openapi-lint job to
the existing .github/workflows/ci.yml using Spectral, blocking on every
push/PR. Do not stop until every stage's Definition of Done in
REST_API_TASK.md is met, then report the final numbers.

## Task 12 — CI workflow restructure (user-provided template)
Full spec in CI_RESTRUCTURE_TASK.md at the repo root. Rewrite
.github/workflows/ci.yml to the given 4-job structure (lint, test,
integration, mutation) plus top-level permissions/concurrency/defaults,
while preserving Task 11's openapi-lint job as a 5th job. Requires adapting
placeholders to this repo's real values (postgres creds, DATABASE_URL,
whether integration tests self-migrate, current gremlins version), not
copy-pasting blindly. Every job's commands must be verified locally against
this repo before pushing, and the real GitHub Actions run must be confirmed
green via gh run watch. Do not stop until every requirement in
CI_RESTRUCTURE_TASK.md is met.

## Task 13 — Docker Hub publish job in CI
Added a `docker-publish` job to .github/workflows/ci.yml, gated on
`needs: [lint, test, integration, openapi-lint]` and
`if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` (never
runs on PRs, only after all quality gates pass on a real push to main).
Builds and pushes the existing repo-root Dockerfile to Docker Hub under the
`claudioed` namespace, tagged `latest` + short git SHA, linux/amd64 only,
using GitHub Actions cache (type=gha) to speed up rebuilds. Requires the
repo to have `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secrets configured
(user-provided, not committed anywhere).

## Task 14 — Architecture fitness tests (ArchUnit equivalent: arch-go)
Full spec in ARCH_TEST_TASK.md at the repo root. Add
internal/architecture/architecture_test.go using github.com/arch-go/arch-go
to encode the hexagonal dependency rule as executable Go tests (domain
depends on nothing internal, application depends only on domain, inbound and
outbound adapters never depend on each other, only cmd/ wires everything).
New arch-test CI job, added to docker-publish's needs list. Strictly
additive -- do not touch existing production code; if a real architecture
violation is found, report it explicitly rather than silently working around
it. Do not stop until every requirement in ARCH_TEST_TASK.md is met.

## Task 15 — Helm chart lint CI job
Added a `helm-lint` job to .github/workflows/ci.yml using
helm/chart-testing-action@v2.8.0 (`ct lint`) against
charts/wes-work-planning. Runs on every push/PR (no gating condition, always
blocking), and wired into `docker-publish`'s `needs` list alongside the
existing gates -- a chart that fails helm/Chart.yaml validation or YAML
style rules never reaches Docker Hub either. Verified locally with
`ct lint --charts charts/wes-work-planning --validate-maintainers=false
--check-version-increment=false` before pushing (chart-testing v3.14.0,
yamllint installed via Homebrew).
