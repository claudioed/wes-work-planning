# planning-mfe

The `wes-work-planning` Module Federation remote. Exposes `./App` (mounted
by `warehouse-console` at `/planning/*` as `planning_mfe`) and is also
runnable standalone for local development:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # http://localhost:5183, standalone (no shell)
```

Talks directly to wes-work-planning's own REST API (`WES_HTTP_PORT=8083`
per `e2e-tests/env.sh`) via `src/config.ts`'s `WES_API_BASE`.

See `order-management/web/README.md` and the top-level `CLAUDE.md` for the
shared MFE conventions this remote follows (ui-kit, module federation
shape, per-service port map).
