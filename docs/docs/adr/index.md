# Architecture Decision Records

An **Architecture Decision Record** captures one architecturally significant
decision: the forces that applied, the choice that was made, and what that
choice costs. These records use
[Michael Nygard's template](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions),
the de facto standard: one Markdown file per decision, numbered `0001-`,
`0002-`, …, never renumbered.

## Why they exist

Code shows *what* was decided. It almost never shows *what else was considered*
or *what the decision cost* — and those are exactly the things a future reader
needs before changing it.

A record is written when the answer to "why is it like this?" would otherwise
be lost, or when someone would reasonably assume the current design was an
accident. Two of the records here exist precisely because the design looks
*wrong* at first glance:
[ADR-0006](./0006-labor-plan-view-not-shift-plan.md) (two types with the same
name that must not be merged) and
[ADR-0003](./0003-flow-balancing-as-domain-service.md) (a decision engine with
no scheduler).

## The records

| # | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [0001](./0001-hexagonal-ports-and-adapters.md) | Hexagonal (ports & adapters) architecture | Accepted |
| [0002](./0002-waveless-continuous-release.md) | Waveless continuous release over wave-based batching | Accepted |
| [0003](./0003-flow-balancing-as-domain-service.md) | Flow balancing as a domain service, not a scheduled batch job | Accepted |
| [0004](./0004-kafka-integration-events.md) | Kafka integration events with a shared envelope and a CloudEvents type convention | Accepted |
| [0005](./0005-rfc-7807-problem-details.md) | RFC 7807 `application/problem+json` for every error response | Accepted |
| [0006](./0006-labor-plan-view-not-shift-plan.md) | Project Workforce's `ShiftPlanCommitted` into a separate read model, not our `ShiftPlan` aggregate | Accepted |

| [0008](./0008-mcp-inbound-adapter.md) | Model Context Protocol as an inbound adapter, not a new service | Accepted |
| [0009](./0009-product-classification-propagation-to-work-released.md) | Propagate inventory-storage's `ProductClassification` onto `WorkReleased` via a synchronous read at release time | Accepted |
| [0010](./0010-gift-wrap-as-a-work-released-characteristic.md) | Gift wrap as a caller-stated `WorkReleased` characteristic, not a product attribute | Accepted |
| [0011](./0011-analytical-data-product.md) | Per-service analytical data product (report) via a separate analytics topic | Accepted |
| [0012](./0012-process-path-catalogue-validation.md) | Process-path catalogue validation, mirroring fulfillment-execution's ADR-0017 | Accepted |
| [0013](./0013-standard-metrics-convention.md) | Standard metrics convention across the fleet: Tier 1 OTel baseline + Tier 2 business-metric naming | Accepted |

## The template

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN — Short present-tense title

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-NNNN

## Context
The forces at play: technical, business, domain. Written so a reader who was
not in the room can see why a decision was needed at all. Facts, not
justification.

## Decision
The choice, stated in the active voice: "We will …".

## Consequences
What becomes easier, what becomes harder, and what is now hard to reverse.
Both the good and the bad — a record that lists only benefits is marketing,
not a decision record.
```

## Status lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Proposed** | Open for discussion; not yet acted on. |
| **Accepted** | In force. The code reflects it. |
| **Deprecated** | No longer applied, with no direct replacement. |
| **Superseded by ADR-NNNN** | Replaced by a later record. |

An accepted record is **never edited to reflect a change of mind** and never
deleted. Superseding it with a new record preserves the reasoning that applied
at the time, which is the only reason the archive is worth keeping.

## Proposing a new one

1. Copy the template into `docs/docs/adr/NNNN-short-title.md`, taking the next
   free number.
2. Set `Status: Proposed`.
3. Add it to the table above and to the `adr/` section of
   [`docs/sidebars.ts`](https://github.com/claudioed/wes-work-planning/blob/main/docs/sidebars.ts).
4. Open a pull request. The discussion happens on the PR; merging with
   `Status: Accepted` is the act of accepting it.

## Scope

These records cover the **Work Planning & Release** bounded context only. Each
sibling service keeps its own. Where a decision is genuinely platform-wide —
the integration envelope, for instance — the record states so explicitly and
notes that the same decision is recorded in the other repositories.
